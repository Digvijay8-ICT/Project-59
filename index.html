        <p>My hobby is reading, coding and singing in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to do such things after completing my home work. I am 12 years old and study in class 6th Standard and almost about to shift to 7th Standard. Now I know very well that reading, coding and singing is very good habit which can make me a complete. These hobby's can be developed by anyone however I got these naturally. Reading books, coding and singing songs keep one always happy and busy. These are the good sources of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction.</p>
